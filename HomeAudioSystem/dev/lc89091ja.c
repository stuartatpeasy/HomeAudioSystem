    lc89091ja.c  - definitions related to the driver for the LC89091JA-H digital audio interface
    receiver.

    Stuart Wallace <stuartw@atom.net>, September 2018.

    Ideally this driver would use the LC89091JA-H's I2C interface to configure the device.  I have,
    however, been unable to make this interface work reliably.  This is probably a consequence of a
    bug in the lib/twi.c module, although this module drives other I2C devices (e.g. the TAS5760M)
    perfectly reliably.  Fortunately the LC89091JA-H can, for the purposes of this project, be
    driven in "hardware mode" without recourse to the internal registers.  Consequently this driver
    uses GPIO pins to monitor the status of the chip.
